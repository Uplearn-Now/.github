## Hi There 👋

Welcome to the repository for Uplearn Now.
We are focused on improving learning outcomes for all children.
We are just getting started.

While we are preparing the first delvierables, we are all ears to hear from you.

What are some #TechForGood requests you have for helping children learn better?

Please send us a note to [help@uplearnnow.com](mailto:help@uplearnnow.com)
thanks

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
